### Issues
This is on beta test, any issue or problem, tell me with github issues options. Thanks.

Known issue: Sometimes it will appear always the same friends. Just clean the cache, logout and login again and it will works.

### Liability
I don't take no liability for the usage of this. At LinkedIn terms, they say that's prohibited the use of BOTS. I think you are not going to get problems, because the macro recuse some requests, and accept some others, wait 1.5 seconds for clicking in add friend, and refresh like 3 or 4 times (Made for getting friends at normal-human speed). But I give no guarantee that you won't get some 24 to 48 hours block, or any bigger problem. Careful usage, please!

#### *Plot Twist*
You can use the version 1 with the version 2 in the same time. It will  get you LIKELY 10.000 friends in 1 day (average calculating the media 100/hour with v1, and 300/hour with v2)

Just open one CMD/Terminal in sandbox or virtual machine, and another as common user (or use 2 computers)

#### *Experimental Version*
Just add the macro experimental.iim in iMacros. :]
